### How To Use
## A practice run is recommended to ensure everything works as intended when required.
- 1 - Download Zip folder of program from https://github.com/napierarchery/freshers_mailing_list
- 2 - Extract contents from Zip folder. To find executable program, go to \freshers_mailing_list\NUAC Freshers Mailing List\bin\Debug.
- 3 - Run the Executable program: NUAC Freshers Mailing List.exe
- 4 - Enter a group name for your mailing list and press initialise.
- 5 - Let the freshers type in their data.
- 6 - Close the program using Alt + F4
If some NED ends the program early, just start it again, initialise and continue from where you left off.

### Loading Data To Gmail
- 1 - Sign in to Google as Napier Archery. A delegated account won't work.
- 2 - In the Google Apps menu (beside the notification icon) go to Contacts.
- 3 - Click the More menu on the left of the screen and select Import.
- 4 - Select Import from CSV.
- 4 - Select the MailingList.csv file in C:\NapierArchery
- 5 - Hit Import. You're done.

If you want, you can view and edit the CSV file prior to upload. Don't edit the columns or headings. Only do this if you make a backup of the file first.
